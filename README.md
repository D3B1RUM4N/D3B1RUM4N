### Hi there 👋

I'm an IT Student working on my portfolio.<br>
Here you will find my personnal project AND my school project !

🏗️ This page is still under construction 🚧

*Let's start with my personnal project*
I worked on those on my free time. Some of them motivated from game and other to learn a new language and even some to train for school project.

- [LSPD-Arkana](https://github.com/Goceane149/LSPD-Arkana) 
> This project was made for a game I played where I roleplayed as a police officer in a big city with other player roleplaying other jobs etc..
> I wanted to make easyer the game for the other police and make the game more immersive.
> So instead of just writing the offense, report or the criminal record of a citizen on a google sheet, I decided with a friend of that game to create an "intranet".
> The goal was to implement it in the game so when the player want it, it open a tab on the game with that website.
> So it was made with Laravel (framework i learnt in school so i can perfect it) with a friend that had to do the CSS part.
> It was not finished because the server where we played the game has stopped and closed.

- [LS-Transit-ThunderRP](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/LS-Transit-ThunderRP)
> Same reason than *LSPD-Arkana*, But this time my roleplay was to be CEO of a transport company.
> I wanted my employee to be able to add new bill for when they transported people (taxi) or ware with trucks.
> then I wanted for me and my co-boss to be able to make new bonuses for the employee depending on how much bill they did.
> Did it with Laravel as well.
