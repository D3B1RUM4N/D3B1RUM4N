### Hi there 👋

I'm an IT Student working on my portfolio.<br>
Here you will find my personnal project AND my school project !

I have a weird username right ? It is because I want to keep anonymity on the internet !

🏗️ This page is still under construction 🚧

*Let's start with my personnal project*
I worked on those on my free time. Some of them motivated from game and other to learn a new language and even some to train for school project.

- [LSPD-Arkana](https://github.com/Goceane149/LSPD-Arkana) 
> This project was made for a game I played where I roleplayed as a police officer in a big city with other players roleplaying different jobs, etc.
> I wanted to make the game easier for the other police and make the game more immersive. So instead of just writing the offense, report, or the criminal record of a citizen on a Google Sheet,
> I decided with a friend from that game to create an "intranet." The goal was to implement it in the game, so when the player wants it, it opens a tab in the game with that website.
> So, it was made with Laravel (a framework I learned in school so I could perfect it) with a friend who had to do the CSS part.
> It was not finished because the server where we played the game has stopped and closed.

- [LS-Transit-ThunderRP](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/LS-Transit-ThunderRP)
> Same reason as LSPD-Arkana, but this time my roleplay was to be the CEO of a transport company.
> I wanted my employees to be able to add new bills for when they transported people (taxi) or goods with trucks.
> Then, I wanted both me and my co-boss to be able to create new bonuses for the employees depending on how many bills they completed.
> I did it with Laravel as well.

- [ModerationBot](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/ModerationBot)
> This is my first java script Discord Bot.
> He is under developpement and more feature are to come.
> He mostly do some moderation but he will be able to play music in a near futur

- [RPBot](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/ShadowForce)
> This one work like *ModerationBot* But I use it on the discord server where i roleplay
> The goal is to add fun things that can be used. Like when i play as a gang member the bot will be able to create crypted message to other gangs or anonyme messages
> It is very experimental since I add things that go through my mind that could be fun. I just want to experiment Discord.js
