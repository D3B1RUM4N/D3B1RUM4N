### Hi there 👋

### About me
I'm an IT Student working on my portfolio.<br>
Here you will find my personnal project AND my school project !

I have a weird username right ? It is because I want to keep anonymity on the internet !

#### What about this repository ?
I want to create my own website using Symfony. A framework I have to learn. This website will be my portfolio, and I want to sell my services on it.

🏗️ This page is still under construction 🚧

#### *Let's start with my personnal project*
I worked on those on my free time. Some of them motivated from game and other to learn a new language and even some to train for school project.

- [LSPD-Arkana](https://github.com/Goceane149/LSPD-Arkana) | ``php Laravel``
> This project was made for a game I played where I roleplayed as a police officer in a big city with other players roleplaying different jobs, etc.
> I wanted to make the game easier for the other police and make the game more immersive. So instead of just writing the offense, report, or the criminal record of a citizen on a Google Sheet,
> I decided with a friend from that game to create an "intranet." The goal was to implement it in the game, so when the player wants it, it opens a tab in the game with that website.
> So, it was made with Laravel (a framework I learned in school so I could perfect it) with a friend who had to do the CSS part.
> It was not finished because the server where we played the game has stopped and closed.

- [LS-Transit-ThunderRP](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/LS-Transit-ThunderRP) | ``php Laravel``
> Same reason as LSPD-Arkana, but this time my roleplay was to be the CEO of a transport company.
> I wanted my employees to be able to add new bills for when they transported people (taxi) or goods with trucks.
> Then, I wanted both me and my co-boss to be able to create new bonuses for the employees depending on how many bills they completed.
> I did it with Laravel as well.

- [ModerationBot](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/ModerationBot) | ``Discord.js``
> This is my first java script Discord Bot.
> He is under developpement and more feature are to come.
> He mostly do some moderation but he will be able to play music in a near futur

- [RPBot](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/ShadowForce) | ``Discord.js``
> This one work like *ModerationBot* But I use it on the discord server where i roleplay
> The goal is to add fun things that can be used. Like when i play as a gang member the bot will be able to create crypted message to other gangs or anonyme messages
> It is very experimental since I add things that go through my mind that could be fun. I just want to experiment Discord.js

- L'adriatique | ``php Laravel``
> A real project for a restaurant named L'Adriatique. Still under development.
> It will be their website to display their menu.
> They will have features for them to add new meals without any database programming experience.
> I want their website to be as evolutionary as I can.
> I prefer to keep the repository private to avoid leaking any data.


#### School Project
Most of them are cloned from my school's GitLab. Some are group project, other are Solo.<br>
they are documented in french.

- [Ethernet with C](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/ShadowForce) | ``c``
> The goal of that project was to create a simulation of an Internet protocol in C.
> It would send a packet from one computer to another, going through switches and populating the switching table.

- [PumlFromJava](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/PumlFromJava) | ``Java``
> Here is a Java project. The goal was to create a .puml file of the class diagram of a Java package we gave in parameters.
> We developed this using object-oriented development.

- [Shock of Perspective](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/Shock-of-Perspectives) | ``Vue.js``
> Here is my biggest project. It was so different from what I have ever done.
> We had two sentences for the subject, and we had to do a full serious game about it.
> We had no more explanation, and we could do anything we wanted.
> We decided to do it with Vue.js as a web app with Electron.js.

- [Mastermind](https://github.com/D3B1RUM4N/Mastermind) | ``Java SWING``
> We made a [Mastermind](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind) using swing and Java
> Not much to tell more 😄
